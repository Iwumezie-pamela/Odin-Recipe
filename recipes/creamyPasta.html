    <p>
      it is an easy version of a creamy alfredo sauce that is made with just a
      handful of ingredients
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound (450g) uncooked pasta (any shape)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
      <li>8 ounces (225g) cream cheese (softened)</li>
      <li>1 cup (250ml) liquid (reserved pasta water, water, vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook Pasta: In a saucepan over medium heat bring about 6 cups of water
        to a boil. When the water boils, add 1 teaspoon of salt and the noodles.
        Then cook the noodles to al dente according to the package instructions.
        When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1-2 cups of the pasta water and drain
        the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté Garlic: In a skillet, melt butter on medium heat and sauté garlic
        very lightly without allowing it to brown. This should be no more than
        30 seconds.
      </li>

      <li>
        Melt the Cream Cheese: Add cream cheese and 1 cup of reserved pasta
        water to the skillet. Use a whisk and allow the cream cheese to melt
        into the sauce as you whisk that together to emulsify the sauce.
      </li>

      <li>
        Finish: Add parmesan cheese, whisking until it melts, then season with
        ground black pepper and salt. Be sure to taste your sauce as you season.
        Parmesan is salty so you may not need as much salt as you think. Remove
        the sauce from the heat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Toss with Pasta: Add the cooked pasta and parsley to the sauce and toss
        using kitchen tongs until the sauce coats the pasta. If the sauce is too
        thick, add more of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.
      </li>
    </ol>
